 * Error Codes (errno.h)
 *
 * This header file defines a set of standard error codes.
 * The error codes *mostly* follow the values of standard POSIX error codes.
 */

/* EIO (5): Input/output error.
 * This error indicates a generic I/O error. It is often returned when a low-level I/O
 * operation fails, typically in a driver.
 */
#define EIO 5

/* EBADF (9): Bad file descriptor.
 * This error is returned when an invalid identifier is used. It can be an index or an
 * address to a file or resource.
 */
#define EBADF 9

/* EAGAIN (11): Try again.
 * This error indicates that a resource is temporarily unavailable, but the operation
 * may succeed if retried.
 */
#define EAGAIN 11

/* ENOMEM (12): Out of memory.
 * This error occurs when a memory allocation request cannot be fulfilled due to
 * insufficient memory (e.g., msgq, mem_slab).
 */
#define ENOMEM 12

/* EBUSY (16): Device or resource busy.
 * This error is returned when a device or resource is currently in use and cannot
 * be accessed or modified (e.g., workqueue, drivers).
 */
#define EBUSY 16

/* EINVAL (22): Invalid argument.
 * This error indicates that an invalid argument was passed to a function.
 */
#define EINVAL 22

/* ENOMSG (35): No message.
 * This error is returned when a message is not available in the message queue.
 */
#define ENOMSG 35

/* ENOTSUP (95): Operation not supported.
 * This error indicates that the operation is not supported or implemented.
 */
#define ENOTSUP 95

/* EALREADY (114): Operation already in progress.
 * This error occurs when an operation is already in progress and cannot be started
 * again.
 */
#define EALREADY 114

/* ETIMEDOUT (110): Operation timed out.
 * This error indicates that an operation timed out before completion.
 * This error will often appear when a synchronization primitive does not complete
 * within a specified timeout.
 */
#define ETIMEDOUT 110

/* ECANCELED (125): Operation canceled.
 * This error is returned when an operation is explicitly canceled before it is
 * completed. This error will often appear when a synchronization primitive is
 * canceled before completion by a k_*object*_*cancel() function.
