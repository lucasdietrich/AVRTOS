/*
 * Event Handling
 *
 * The event handling system provides a mechanism for scheduling
 * and managing events that occur after a specified delay or at regular intervals.
 * Events are typically used to trigger specific actions at a later time, such as
 * handling timeouts, periodic tasks, or deferred processing.
 *
 * Events are managed through an event queue that ensures they are executed in a
 * timely manner based on their scheduled time. Each event is associated with a
 * handler function that is called when the event is triggered. Events can be
 * scheduled, canceled, and checked for pending status.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - **Time-based Event Scheduling**: Events can be scheduled to trigger after a
 *   specified timeout, making it easy to implement timeouts and delays in your
 *   system.
 * - **Immediate Execution Option**: Events can be executed immediately if no delay
 *   is needed, bypassing the scheduling mechanism.
 * - **Interrupt-safe Operations**: Events can be scheduled and canceled from interrupt
 *   context.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - Like software timers (timer.h), the main limitation is that the events are processed
 *   within the tick interrupt handler (kernel code), the code executed in the handler
 * must then be compliant with the constraints of the interrupt context.
 *
 * Related configuration options:
 *  - CONFIG_KERNEL_EVENTS: Enables the event handling system.
 *  - CONFIG_KERNEL_TIME_SLICE_US: Defines the time slice used for event processing.
 *  - CONFIG_KERNEL_EVENTS_ALLOW_NO_WAIT: Allows events to be executed immediately without
 * delay.
